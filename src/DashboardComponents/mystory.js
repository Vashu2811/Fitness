                    I was not born with a good physique. From a young age I was unsatisfied with the way I looked. 
                    Growing up skinny, I eventually wanted to make a difference in my teenage years and build a 
                    physique that I could be both confident and proud of. So I spent the past 12 years learning 
                    more about the intricacies of applied fitness and health – and I fell in love.

                    Fitness is not my life. Without a real life fitness role model, I tried countless workouts, 
                    programs and even diets (some good, some bad) that I could find on the internet while being 
                    a full-time A+ student and running track & field. And over the course of 11 years, juggling 
                    fitness with the rest of my life, I slowly trained myself the nuances of building muscle and 
                    getting lean to build the physique that you see today – all the while being a full-time student 
                    graduating with Highest Honors in both High School and University.

                    I am proud to have found a balance where I can smash my fitness goals while still enjoying 
                    the other important aspects of life – good food, good friends, good memories. Today, I’ve 
                    helped hundreds of other normal people incorporate fitness sustainably into their busy lives 
                    while still maintaining the other aspects of life that people find enjoyable.

                    ‍Here’s one of the biggest things I learned over those 12 years, I attribute my success in 
                    fitness to one fundamental thing – consistency. I learned that the most important factor 
                    in building the physique of your dreams is finding a fitness routine that fits with your schedule – 
                    don’t make fitness your life, make fitness part of your lifestyle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ‍I found my path in fitness all the while living a life outside of it, let me help you find yours.
